- **Project Summary**: 
  - Background/Motivation
    
    Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes grew by 0.9% or 321 Mt in 2022, reaching up to a new all-time high of 36.8 Gt (IEA 2023). However, Emissions need to fall to 9.7 Gt in 2050 for an emissions pathway compatible with the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement (Gielen et al. 2019). Renewable energy makes up most of the emission reductions. Therefore, with the growing global demand for renewable energy, understanding the main factors affecting energy consumption becomes crucial. The proliferation of renewable energy is essential for achieving climate targets, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and promoting sustainable economic development.
    
  - Research Questions
    1. What is the current CO2 emission situation globally?
    2. What is the best model that fits the prediction curve concerning renewable energy consumption among linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting?
    3. What is the trend of renewable energy consumption going in the coming 3 years?

  - Application Scenario (Data Source)
    
    [Global data on sustainable energy (2021-2022)](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators) from WDI and [Global data on sustainable energy (2000-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy) on Kaggle. A total of one dataset with 21 columns and 3649 data items is involved.
    
  - Methodology

    First, this research applies data visualization to uncover the CO2 Emission Situation and raises the significance of energy consumption. Second, it provides classification by continent and then continues to focus on Asia. Third, it explores the Correlation among indicators via Heatmap and Scatterplot, to find the significant features of renewable energy consumption. Last, this research applies three models for Prediction: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting; and the VAR Vector autoregressive model) for forecasting the future trend.
    
  - Results

    The study found that Carbon dioxide emissions have fluctuated rapidly over the past two decades. Moreover, Asia's energy consumption is growing significantly. In addition, through the VAR model, the study finds that renewable energy consumption in Asia will continue to rise in the coming years till 2025.
    
  - Intellectual Merits and Practical impacts of your project.

    1. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, this research raises the significance of renewable energy and provides the forecasting of energy consumption trends.
    2. By leveraging this dataset, this research intends to uncover insights into the evolving landscape of energy consumption patterns. This endeavor contributes to well-informed decision-making in the domains of energy policies and investments.
